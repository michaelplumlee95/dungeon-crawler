goblin,10,0,12,10,1,10,1d4,assets/goblin.txt,"A small, crafty scavenger that raids camps for anything shiny or edible."
slime,15,0,14,20,1,8,1d3,assets/slime.txt,"Ah, the classic slime. Squishy, jiggly, mildly aggressive gelatin. Honestly, if you’re gonna get mauled by something in here, this is the one you want—it’s like being slapped by a sentient bowl of soup. Not the brightest blob in the bunch, but don’t let your guard down. Some of 'em can split into smaller slimes when you whack 'em. It’s like fighting a dessert that multiplies when you stab it. Horrifying. Fun fact, Some slimes absorb books. Not to read—just to digest. Which is, frankly, a hate crime against literature."
spider,7,0,8,5,1,12,1d3,assets/spider.txt,"Ah, yes—the giant dungeon spider. Eight legs, too many eyes, and a real flair for redecorating with webbing. Honestly, if they ever teamed up with an interior designer, we’d all be doomed.  They're fast, sneaky, and love to drop down from ceilings like surprise parties you never asked for. Oh, and their venom? Let’s just say it’s not great for your whole ‘being alive’ thing. I guess not in your case though.  Fun fact, these creepy crawlers love music. Not in a dancing kind of way—they just vibrate to the beat and think it’s prey. So, uh… maybe don’t hum."
fire spirit,1,3,3,15,3,6,2d3,assets/fire spirit.txt,"Ah, fire spirits. Living, floating bundles of bad decisions and spontaneous combustion. They’re made entirely of flame and pure chaotic energy, and they really don’t care about your personal space. Fast, tricky, and annoyingly cheerful about setting everything you love on fire, fire spirits aren't particularly strong individually—but they tend to travel in irritating little swarms. Like fireflies, if fireflies wanted you dead. Fun fact, Fire spirits are technically classified as “elementals,” but good luck getting one to sit still long enough for paperwork."
cultist,15,1,12,50,4,5,1d6,assets/cultist.txt,"Cultists! Just your average, everyday citizens who woke up one morning and thought, ‘You know what would really spice up my life? Summoning an ancient evil to devour the world.’  They’re fanatical, spooky, and extremely good at chanting ominous nonsense in dark rooms. Most of them serve demons—either because they want power, or because nobody explained to them that making deals with bloodthirsty interdimensional horrors tends to end... poorly.  Fun fact, Most cultists don’t even get cool powers. Best case, they get eaten last. Talk about lousy benefits."
demon,25,3,12,100,5,4,1d8,assets/demon.txt,"Demons, eh? Now there’s a bunch you don’t wanna owe a favor to. They come in all shapes—horns, wings, fire-for-eyes, the whole dramatic package. Most of ‘em come from realms where the laws of reality are more like polite suggestions. They're clever, powerful, and usually up to no good… unless no good is the job.  Fun fact, some demons are obsessed with collecting things—cursed coins, haunted dolls, even ancient love letters. Kinda sweet, in a bone-chilling, soul-bargainy way."
orc,25,2,13,100,5,4,1d8,assets/orc.txt,"Orcs—big, green, terrifying boulders with legs. Built like siege engines and usually louder. People say they’ve got no brains, but let me tell you, that’s a dangerous assumption to make right before getting launched into a wall.  They’ve got this whole code thing—strength, honor, loyalty—real noble, real stabby. Upside? If one likes you, they’ll probably just throw things for you instead of at you. Which is sweet, in a deeply unsettling way.  Fun fact: Some orcs can sing opera. No, really. Deep, booming ballads that shake the bones in your ribcage. I cried once. Told everyone it was the dungeon dust."
automaton,30,2,15,150,7,3,1d8,assets/automaton.txt,"Automatons. Gears, metal, magic, and absolutely zero sense of humor. These clanky constructs were built long ago—probably by some wizard who thought 'you know what’s better than having friends? Having robots that punch things.'  They don't eat, sleep, or complain, which frankly makes them unnervingly efficient at smashing anything that moves. Most are programmed to defend ancient ruins or forgotten treasure, and let's just say... customer service isn’t in their operating system.  Fun fact, If you hear clicking and whirring nearby, that's either an automaton... or a very angry wind-up toy. Gamble wisely."
hydra,75,3,17,750,8,1,2d4,assets/hydra.txt,"Ah, the Hydra. Because when you think, ‘fighting one monster isn’t enough,’ the universe laughs and gives you five heads instead.  Every time you cut off one of their heads, two more can grow back—unless you figure out how to stop it. (Spoiler: whacking wildly with your sword isn’t going to cut it. Literally.) They’re vicious, stubborn, and somehow manage to argue with themselves while trying to eat you.  Fun fact: Hydras have a terrible sense of personal space. Mostly because when you have eight heads, there is no personal space."
lich,75,3,14,600,8,5,2d3,assets/lich.txt,"Liches. Ugh. Fancy necromancers who couldn’t handle the idea of a normal afterlife, so they ripped out their own souls and stapled themselves to reality. Dramatic much?  Sure, they’ve got big magic and armies of undead, but honestly? Most of them spend their eternity brooding in dusty halls, practicing evil monologues, and pretending they’re better than the rest of us regular necromancers. Spoiler: they're not.  You see a lich, don’t be impressed. Be ready. They didn’t get that wrinkly by being nice—and if they catch you, you’re probably getting turned into a lawn ornament.  Fun fact, every lich anchors their soul to a special object called a “phylactery.” Find it, smash it, and watch them scream like a banshee with a stubbed toe. Highly recommended."
dragon,100,4,18,1000,10,1,2d6,assets/dragon.txt,"Ah, the dragon. Big, scaly, fire-breathing tax evaders. These majestic lizards are ancient, powerful, and have very strong opinions about who’s allowed near their piles of shiny junk.  They fly, they roast, they monologue—honestly, they’re just magical reptiles with a superiority complex and a flame thrower for a throat. Most of them can smell fear... or maybe that’s just the smoke from the last poor soul who wandered in.  Fun fact, despite their terrifying reputation, dragons are terrible at board games. Always hoarding all the pieces and setting the rulebooks on fire."
cyclops,100,3,19,1000,10,1,2d6,assets/cyclops.txt,"Cyclops. Big, grumpy, and about as subtle as a catapult in a teacup shop. These towering one-eyed brutes are strong enough to snap a tree like a breadstick and dumb enough to argue with walls—and lose.  They aren’t complicated: if it moves, they smash it. If it doesn't move, they smash it just to be sure. Their one eye might make them look goofy, but don't let that fool you. They can spot a target across a battlefield... assuming they remember which way they're facing.  Fun fact, Cyclopses are terrible at games of hide-and-seek. And riddles. And really, anything that isn’t smashing."
danmon,1,0,0,0,10,1,1d1,assets/danmon.txt,"Ah, the legendary Danmon. Looks like someone slapped a beard on a Pikachu and called it a day—and honestly? I'm here for it.  Don’t worry, this little guy’s pretty harmless. Shocks people occasionally, sure, but it’s more of a 'hey, notice me' zap than a 'your skeleton is now outside your body' situation. Mostly, he just kind of vibes.  I first heard about Danmons from an old mage named Ethalamos. He barged into my tower one night, waving a notebook full of scribbles and shouting about 'the bearded thunder sprite.' Naturally, I assumed he needed a nap. Turns out he needed a Danmon.  Fun fact, Compliment its beard and you might earn a lifetime of slightly static-charged friendship."
lich king,200,4,19,5000,20,1,2d8,assets/lich king.txt,"And now... the Lich King. My ultimate rival, the overcooked bonehead who thinks he’s soooo much better than me just because he’s got an army, a throne made of skeletons, he's not suffering from mild to severe monster-phobia, has a mostly humanoid body shape and chisled jaw line, and—oh yeah—probably stole my Necronomicon.  He’s the big boss down here. Stronger than any regular lich, craftier than a tomb full of traps, and about as charming as a graveyard at midnight. Be warned: even if you defeat him, he’s so tied up in dark magic and stubborn pride that he doesn’t stay gone for long. He’s like a bad rash with a crown.  I know you can’t kill him for good... but if you give him a good ass-whooping? Oh, I’ll be thrilled. Maybe even buy you a ghost cake or something.  Fun fact, The Lich King insists on being called “His Eternal Majesty.” I prefer “That Overdramatic Sack of Bones.” Tomato, tomahto."
